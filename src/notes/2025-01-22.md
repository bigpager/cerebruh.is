Trying out Foam... I guess this is the default daily note template. Hmmm... not bad. (Pats roof of car)... Markdown.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog, donchaknow.

I like the look of Logseq better. I wonder if this is configurable. Also can we [[make-files-on-the-fly]]... not really.

Also, what about
    bulleted
    lists
    I 
    guess

that worked?

    weird
    is that just how #vscode works?

    I guess it needs [[vscode]] (hashtag syntax doesn't work)

        more

            indentation

                levels


my earliest post though is [[idk what this is...pl]]
